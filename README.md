# Overview

Open Content Spec Version 0.1

This document outlines content types for the Open Content Spec (OCS).  OCS provides an opinionated specification for how content should be formatted for publishing to mobile applications that deliver educational, entertainment, news and other media content.

The OCS format allows content creators to develop content that is agnostic to a given content management system (CMS).  If the CMS supports OCS, then content can be authored in advance and imported into that CMS at any time.  This accelerates content interation where custom content schemas have historically been a blocker to deploying online publishing systems at scale.  This pain is even more accute in developing CMS schemas for mobile phones.  As a result, OCS is intentionally optimized for short-form mobile interactions.  These constraints will not work for many scenarios.  Please consider these constraints in your evalution of OCS for your scenario.
